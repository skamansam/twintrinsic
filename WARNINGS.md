## Warning Categories

### state_referenced_locally (Most Common)
Props being captured in closures without proper effect wrapping. Solution: Wrap in `$effect()` or use `$derived()`.

### non_reactive_update
Variables being updated without `$state()` declaration. Solution: Declare with `$state()`.

### Slot Deprecation
Using `<slot>` instead of `{@render ...}` tags. Solution: Replace with `{@render children?.()}` or similar.

### Accessibility Issues
- Missing tabindex on interactive elements
- Invalid href attributes
- Form labels not associated with controls
- Aria attributes not supported by role

### Other
- Invalid role/attribute combinations
- Redundant roles
