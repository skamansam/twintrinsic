# Planning Documents

This folder contains planning files created by agents working on Twintrinsic. These documents track project scope, implementation strategies, migration progress, and other planning artifacts that help coordinate work across sessions.

## Purpose

Planning files help agents:
- Track progress on large-scale refactoring or migration efforts
- Document implementation strategies and decisions
- Coordinate work across multiple components or features
- Maintain context for multi-session projects

## Guidelines

- Keep planning files concise and focused on actionable items
- Update progress regularly as work completes
- Link to relevant code, PRs, or issues when applicable
- Archive or remove completed plans to keep the folder organized
